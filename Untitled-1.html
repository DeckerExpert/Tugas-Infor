			<h1>So, you want to try Linux?</h1>
			<h2>You have endured Microsoft's borderline predatory business practicies and policies for quite a while now, and you've decided that enough is enough and you want to see what else is in stock for an operating system other than Windows.</h2>
			<p>Well, you're in luck! This website will be a quick introduction towards the Linux, or rather GNU/Linux, operating system.</p>

			<h1>But First! What exactly <i>is</i> Linux?</h1>
			<div class="middle_body">
				<p>Linux is an open-source operating system that has gained immense popularity among users and developers alike. Unlike proprietary operating systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is built on a collaborative model, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute its source code. The flexible nature of Linux invites developers to make their own version of Linux, tailored to their specific use case. These versions of Linux are called Distributions, often times shortened to "Distros".</p>
				<p>There is a near uncountable amount of Linux Distros, each made for a specific use case. Such examples include NixOS, Debian Linux, Ubuntu, Slackware, and the list goes on.</p>
				</div>
			<h2> To show the scale on the amount of Linux distributions that exist, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg">here is a timeline</a> showcasing every mildly popular Linux distro since 1992!</h2>
				<hr>
			<h2 style="text-align: center">However, for simplicity's sake, we'll only be focusing on Linux Mint.</h2>
			<div class="middle_body">
				<p>Linux Mint is a Ubuntu-based Linux distribution that is designed to provide a comfortable and familiar computing experience, especially for users transitioning from Windows(You!). Linux Mint was launched in 2006 and was designed to be a user-friendly Linux distro aimed for people who wants something that "Just Works".</p>
			</div>
			<div class="center_it">
				<h3 >Due to the simple nature of Linux Mint along with the insurrmountable amount of user-created content made with Linux Mint in mind, this introduction will focus mainly on it.</h3>
